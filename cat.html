    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous 
    mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family 
    Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish 
    it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house 
    cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and 
    avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans 
    for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 
    cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it 
    has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and 
    retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night 
    vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication 
    includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, 
    growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 
    A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a 
    solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too 
    faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those 
    made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives 
    pheromones.[8]

    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late 
    autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five 
    kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as 
    registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. 
    Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and 
    neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large 
    numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction 
    of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking 
    population control.[10]

    Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.
    [11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated 
    ncient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to
     cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13] As of 2021 there are an 
     estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the
     ld.[14][15] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most 
     popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.
     [16][17][18] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat 
     with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 
     2020.[19]
